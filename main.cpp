/*
Steps: 
1. get functions from student program and configure them to fit with hash table
2. hash table starts with at least 100 slots and deal with collisions, and chaining(linked lists)
3. Have code for cases such as 3 or more collisions, where table is doubled in slots and students are rehashed
4. Create random student generator which student list program takes and adds basic componennets like name, ID, and GPA
